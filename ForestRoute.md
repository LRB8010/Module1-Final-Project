User chooses forest route
Return “You choose the forest knowing that you are prepared for what may come next. As you walk the path, your surroundings grow darker and more menacing. You feel as if someone’s gaze follows and as if expectant hand reaches out to grab you.
    Cold grasp Option 1
    Break into a run, knowing that you’ll be able to make your escape
    Return: You immediately break into a run, desperate to get away. As you round the bend of the path you follow you don’t notice the traveller as you SLAM! into them knocking both of you to the ground. You push yourself up to gather your bearings. You catch the eye of the traveller with which you had your unfortunate encounter. You immediately know that any person in this land or another would be smitten. They are up before you and have readied their weapon thinking you, an attacker.
        Smitten Option 1
        You get to your feet angry they would find themselves in the path of your escape. You will let them know how rude it was to stand where you would be running.
        Return: The traveller’s expression turns from stern to contemptuous. They decide to rob you as recompense for such a trespass. You are allowed to leave naked and embarrassed bringing your journey to an abrupt and frankly, pitiful end. You’ve decided to go be a tax collector and never speak of this again.
        Smitten Option 2
        You apologize immediately knowing not many would take your apology readily.
        Return: Their stern expression softens and they listen to your story and respond to the tale of your fear with an understanding nod. They then offer you a gentle hand to help you to your feet. As you regain your composure they offer to accompany you through the forest. After all, two is better than one.
            The offer Option 1
            Decline their offer
            Although you are eager to continue to behold this new traveller in all their aesthetic wonder you are unsure of this request. Surely many a traveller has met a gruesome end as they blindly trusted someone they had only just met. You kindly decline their offer and move away thinking it best to traveller in a gleeful yet cautious manner.
            The offer Option 2
            Accept their offer
            You think about the offer for moment but not long enough to paint yourself a pest. You smile at them, glad for the company and your first party member. You turn back towards the path that seemed to bring you together. You feel a hopeful light spring to life inside of your chest at the prospect of what is to come. Will your new found companion prove to be an indespensible friend or maybe something a little more? (<3)

    Cold Grasp Option 2
    Turn, raise your weapon and ready yourself for a fight
    Return: You turn to fight, weapon at the ready. You are no fool and certainly will not be had by just any meandering mongrel who dares test your mettle. As you steel yourself for what is sure to be a legendary battle a shadowy figure steps forward. A man stands in front of you with a face difficult to love even by a mother’s low standard.
        U is for Ugly Option 1
        Exclaim “I will never fall to a creature so foul. Have at thee,” you say as you move to strike.
        Failure return “The man before you steps back and gasps. ‘Do you just call anyone you randomly meet in a dark forest ugly or only do so when you refuse to look at your own face?’” The man is clearly offended and as you attempt to find words of apology he strikes you with a small satchel knocking you cold. A deserved blow for not seeing a person for their character and judging solely based on looks. Shame on you. (end)
        U is for Ugly Option 2
        Lower your weapon
        You lower your weapon as they have made no move to harm you. You ask them if they are friend or foe. They offer a gentle if not emotionally perplexing smile making their intent clear. As you settle they explain that they are travelling much like yourself but would enjoy your company as they seek out adventure in lands unknown.
            U is actually for unbeknownst friendships Option 1
            Decline
            You awkwardly decline but thank them for their offer. They turn and walk away as you do so intending to travel the opposite direction. You drop your heavy coin purse without noticing, the first bit of bad luck in an already turbulent attempt at adventure.
            U is actually for unbeknownst friendships Option 2
            Accept
            Your eyes brighten at the thought of your first party member joining you on the path to greatness. You turn to meet them shoulder to shoulder as you both make way down the long road ahead a whispered promise of a budding friendship becoming a lifelong partnership.
